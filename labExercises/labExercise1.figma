Lab #1: Figma

Create a Figma prototype for a social media application, where you can post your
content and posts from other users are visible. Don’t just jump into Figma, try to follow
the design procedure by first clarifying the requirements, understanding the application
flow, and sketching a quick paper mockup.
Also, this could be part of your portfolio, so try to do some research and come up with
a personal design. For example, it could be a social media application dedicated to the
Warhammer Community, or the Ferrari Lovers.
